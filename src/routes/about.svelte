<h1>About 330 Cars</h1>
<p>
	We're locally-owned and operated right here in the 330. We'll get you in the car you need so you
	get there and back in style.
</p>
<h2>Ohio Proud</h2>
<p>
	We are 3rd and 4th generation Ohioans with deep roots in Akron. We will make sure you have a good
	experience renting from us because we know if not our mothers (and grandmas) will call us up about
	it.
</p>
<h2>Her Story</h2>
<p>
	Our founder, Dani Johnson, is Northeast Ohioâ€™s only female car dealership owner. After
	successfully launching and running Her Cars in Akron for 5 years, she founded 330 Cars to meet the
	needs of people in the community who only need a car occasionally.
